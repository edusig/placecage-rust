# Placecage Rust

<!-- <https://placecage.eduardociciliato.com.br>(not up yet.) -->

## Running locally

```bash
cargo run
```

I will start a server on port 8080

## Why?

After the end of the Heroku free plan the original <https://www.placecage.com> website went down. ([See github issue about it](https://github.com/davecowart/placecage/issues/13))

I used it a lot while working with frontend before the company designer decided the final images and it was really easy to spot and replace this kind of placeholder before deploying to production.

This is also a learning exercise for me to learn a little more Rust.
